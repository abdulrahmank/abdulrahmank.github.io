There are lots of Point Of Sale(POS) applications available. Yet there are lot of small scale shops without billing system. The reason for the lack of adoption:
1. **Shop keeper find it unnecessary/difficult to learn the POS application**:
    All the existing POS application are built in a traditional way without much empasie on UX because they de-prioritise easing the UI for shop keepers/cashiers, person who are using the POS

2. The **initial setup is quite costly** and doesn't provide a convincing return on investment.

3. The **maintenance is high**: Most softwares require merchants to pay monthly subscription/yearly subscription. Since most POS's work on windows machine, and since it'll be very difficult for the merchants to keep the machine in the same place, this movement will cause systems to fail and ofter require the merchnats to call the system provider for maintanence, data may even get corrupted.

# **Retail biddah**:

Retail biddah is a product suite that tries to be different than the current available POS's. All the products under the suite is developed to be able to run in any platform, with emphasize on Android OS. Choice of emphasize on android os stems from the popularity of Android.

## How is Retail biddah different?

1\. **_Less to no Learning Curve_**: 

Retail biddah contains products that are designed giving emphasize to ease the UI 
for the first hand users.
 This can be seen from the following example:

**Bill.It.**, a product that shop keepers can use to provide receipts to the customer, allows the shop keepers to add a product to the bill in 5 different ways:
- Using barcode scanner gun
- Using android phone's camera
- By searching for the product by inputing a search term
- By choosing the product from a list which will be present inside the product's brand
- By click of a button (this is used to add new product that is not present in the product directory to the bill)
- We are planning to provide regional language support as well to remove the language barrier too.

These ways are developed so that the Shop keeper can just get onboarded to the application without learning anything. Even need not learn to use keyboard, because most android os have touchscreen peripherals.

2\. **_Very minimal initial setup cost_**: Given the fact that almost all the shop keepers 
own an android device, It just takes few clicks to download the app and getting started. With currently 2000+ products available in the product directory, users can start billing, the moment they download the app.

3\. **_Less and transparent maintainance cost_**: Since we are a lean company, the only cost that we incur is the cost to pay to cloud providers. The choice of cloud platform is also taken very cautioisly keeping cots/reliability in mind.

Merchants will be billed based on the maintainance cost along with some service charges.
