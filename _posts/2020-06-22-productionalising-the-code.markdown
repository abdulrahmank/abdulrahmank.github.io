# Being a well balanced developer - Part 2 (Own your product/feature release)#

Without passion for the code we write and product we develop, we never can be a well balanced developer. Unless and until we see the product in action, we can't quinch the thirst of having developed a good product. 

If we just stop at coding and developing the product, our curiosity to see how our code works in production will be dependent on others like release / devops team. Cases where there is a delay in releasing the feature may give a blow to your enthusiasm. If the same delay in release happens consecutively for few time, the curiosity will become frustration (I have been there). The frustration will gradually lead to loss of interest in the product, as we know that the feature is going to stalled because of various reasons.

Eventhough there may be very valid reasons, our sub conciousness won't accept that.

To mitigate this, we as developers should own our feature releases. Even If there is a dedicated devops team, they shouldn't interfere in the release of features in usual cases. However there can be exceptions, for example devops team can stall a release due to infrastructure update and similar reasons.

If you have reached this far, this article hopes to have ignited the fire of owning your releases ðŸ˜‰.

Having ignited the fire, let us go over couple of well known ways to achieve the ownership of our releases:
1. Microservices environment: With microservices environment, each team will own its service. Smaller the team, higher the responsibility of productionalising our code. 

2. Continuous Integration / Continuous deployment: By this we tend to reduce the number of of steps involved in deployment as deployments need to be continuous
